    <b>EXAMINATIONS</b><br><br>
    <b>(1) Explain what a method is and also what is a function in JavaScript</b><br>
    METHOD: A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method. Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions.A method is a programmed procedure that is defined as part of a class and included in any object of that class. A class (and thus an object) can have more than one method.<br><br>

    FUNCTION: A function is simply a  “chunk” of code that you can use over and over again, rather than writing it out multiple times. Functions enable programmers to break down or decompose a problem into smaller chunks, each of which performs a particular task. A function can be declared(that is calling out the function directly) or expressed(that is assigning a variable to it and then calling the variable). Also, a function is defined as a relation between a set of inputs having one output each. In simple words, a function is a relationship between inputs where each input is related to exactly one output. Every function has a domain and codomain or range. A function is generally denoted by f(x) where x is the input.<br><br><hr>


    <b>(2) Write a code to explain the two further</b><br>
    METHOD:<br>
    var user = {<br>
    name: "Achilihu Daniel",<br>
    state: "Abia",<br>
    bestFood:"Rice",<br>

    data : function daniel(){<br>
    console.log() <br>
    }<br>  
    }<br><br>

    FUNCTION:<br>
    function book(){<br>
    console.log ("this is my book")<br>
    }<br>
    
    book()<br><br><hr>


    <b>(3)what is the difference and similarity between the 2?</b><br>
    DIFFERENCE: The main difference between function and method is that function is free of any object, whereas method itself is static or associated with an object. Function is a code that has to play a role (a function) of doing something. Method is a procedure to resolve the problem.<br><br>
    
    SIMILARITY: Method and a function are the same. A method is a procedure or function in object-oriented programming. A function is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere in your program. This eliminates the need for writing the same code again and again.A function inside an object is called a method. You can say a method is a property that has a function in an object.<br><br><hr>


    <b>(4) what is the difference between an object and an array</b><br>
    OBJECT represent a special data type that is mutable and can be used to store a collection of data (rather than just a single value). They refers to variables which can have more than one properties and can have methods also.<br> 
    
    It is represented like this :<br>
    var user = {<br>
    name: "Achilihu Daniel",<br>
    state: "Abia",<br>
    hobbies: "Football",<br>
    bestFood:"Rice"<br>
    } <br>
            
    while 
    <br><br>
    ARRAY is a special type of variable that is also mutable and can also be used to store a list of values which can be primitive or object.. They are used to store lots of data in javascript and they consits of  an index and length.<br>
    
    It is represented like this:<br>
    var disUser =[<br>
    "Daniel",<br>
    "Football",<br>
    "Rice"<br>
    ]<br><br><hr>
 


    <b>(5) what is ecmascript?</b>
    ECMAscript is a JavaScript standard meant to ensure the interoperability of web pages across different web browsers.ECMAScript is a general-purpose programming language that is implemented in Javascript and some other languages. It is the scripting language that formed the basis of browser-based Javascript and Node.js.<br><br><hr>


    <b>(6) what are primitives and non primitive types of data types</b><br>
    PRIMITIVE TYPES:  They are data types in which their values are immutable(unable to be changed) and their data are stored by value..Examples: Numbers, Strings, Boolean, undefined, Null, Symbol.<br><br>

    NON-PRIMITIVE TYPES: They are data types in which their values are mutable(liable to change) and their data are passed by address or reference. Examples are Object and arrays.<br><br><hr>


    <b>(6b) Explain number 6 with codes</b><br>
    PRIMITIVE TYPES:<br> 
    let trainee1=("Daniel")<br>
    let trainee2=("Daniel")<br>

    if (trainee1===trainee2){console.log (true)}<br>
    else{console.log(false)}<br>
    true<br>
    
    Here variable trainee1 and trainee2 is equal because primitive types of data  are immutable and store their data by value.<br><br>

    NON-PRIMITIVE TYPES:<br>
    let trainee1=["Daniel"]<br>
    let trainee2=["Daniel"]<br>

    if (trainee1===trainee2){console.log(true)}<br>
    else{console.log(false)}<br>
    false<br>
    
    Here variable trainee1 and trainee2 are not equal because non-primitive types of data are mutable and do not store their data by value rather they are stored by address or reference.<br><br><hr>


    <b>(7) Explain what console.log is in JavaScript</b><br>
    console.log() is a function in JavaScript which is used to print any kind of variables defined before in it or to just print any message that needs to be displayed to the user. When writing javascript in VS code, console.log must be included.<br><br><hr>


    <b>(8) Explain alert, confirm, prompt and return in JavaScript.</b><br>
    ALERT: The alert() method is one of the pop up box in JavaScript and it is used to display a virtual alert box. It is mostly used to give a warning message to the users. It displays an alert dialog box that consists of some specified message (which is optional) and an OK button.<br><br>

    CONFIRM: The confirm() method is one of the pop up box in Javascript and it displays a dialog box with a message, an OK button, and a Cancel button. The confirm() method returns true if the user clicked "OK", otherwise false if the user clicked Cancel.<br><br>
  
    PROMPT: The prompt() method is one of the pop up box in JavaScript and is used to display a prompt box that prompts the user for the input. It is generally used to take the input from the user before entering the page. It can be written without using the window prefix.<br><br>

    RETURN: The return statement ends the execution of a function and returns a value or specifies a value to be returned to the function caller.<br><br>
